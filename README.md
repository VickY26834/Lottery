# Project Title: Simple Lottery DApp

## Project Description
The Simple Lottery DApp is a decentralized application built using Solidity that enables users to participate in a transparent lottery system. Participants can enter the lottery by sending a small amount of ETH, and a random winner is picked who receives the entire pot.

## Project Vision

## Key Features
- Only the manager can initiate the winner selection.
- Anyone can enter by paying the minimum ETH.
- Random winner selection using on-chain values.
- Reset functionality for new lottery rounds.

## Future Scope
